# SportsStoreApp

Based on the SportsStore Application built in ['Essential Angular for ASP.NET Core MVC'](https://www.apress.com/9781484229156) by Adam Freeman (Apress, 2017).

The Application is one part Angular and other part ASP.NET Core MVC.

The book uses ASP.NET Core 1.1 and Angular CLI 1.0.2 but this repository uses ASP.NET Core 2.2.0 
and Angular CLI 8.2.3. So far I've been able to code along using the book.

I did, however, start from the VS 2019 Angular Project Template. I tried the same way as the book does but I encountered
too many outdated npm commands and options that had since then been deprecated.

## How to build

Build the project using VS 2019.

## How to run

Open the Solution file and hit F5 to start a debug session.

## UPDATE

The Author published an [Update for Working with ASP.NET Core MVC 2.1 & Angular 5.2](https://github.com/Apress/esntl-angular-for-asp.net-core-mvc/tree/master/Update%20for%20Angular%205.2%20and%20ASP.NET%20Core%202.2)

>This update provides replacement listings and source code for all of the chapters in the original edition of the book.
>I have provided a complete replacement for Chapter 3, which is the most affected by the new release.
